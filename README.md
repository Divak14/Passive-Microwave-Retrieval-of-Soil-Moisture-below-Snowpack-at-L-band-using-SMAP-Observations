# Passive-Microwave-Retrieval-of-Soil-Moisture-below-Snowpack-at-L-band-using-SMAP-Observations
This repository presents a forward emission model to simulate L-band microwave emission of wet soils below dry snowpack covered with an emerging moderately dense vegetation canopy.

Main file: LiveDemo_tau_omega_snow.mlx contains the matlab live file explaining the use of this code.
